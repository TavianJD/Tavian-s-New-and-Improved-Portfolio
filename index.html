                    <p> Hey my name is Tavian Dawson and welcome to my Coding Portfolio! When I think of myself I think of a very caring and easy-going guy and super goofy at times. This is my first time getting involved in technology, but I've always been interested in it. Before I got into this class I was just on a gap year not knowing what I should be doing and this course came up and I am glad I took the opportunity! My favorite things to do include skateboarding, skiing, video games, hanging out with friends, but most importantly traveling!. I haven't got to do much traveling in my life, but every trip is amazing and always catching myself wishing I didn't have to go back home</p>
                    <p>I have always wanted to expand my education beyond high school, I just never knew exactly what that looked like. I want to challenge myself and show to myself that I can do anything I put my mind to even if that means struggling and frustrating myself it's all apart of the process!</p>
